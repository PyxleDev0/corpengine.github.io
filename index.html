    <hmed>What is CORP Engine?</hmed><br /><br />
    CORP Engine is a game engine/toolkit made in Python using the Pygame
    library.<br /><br />
    <hsmall>Why should I use it?</hsmall><br /><br />
    &emsp; ➤ It can really make your python game development experience more
    organized, faster, and better in general.<br />

    &emsp;➤ It has <strong>built-in parent-children system</strong> with
    <strong>game objects</strong> and <strong>services</strong> to use.<br />

    &emsp;➤ It is very simple and efficient to work with compared to Pygame.<br />

    &emsp;➤ Also, the entire engine code is in a single file, making it really
    easy to set up.<br /><br />

    <hsmall>How can I set it up?</hsmall><br /><br />
    &emsp;➤ You can use this repository as a template or git clone it to your
    local machine. This will require git. (Recommended method)<br />
    &emsp;➤ Alternatively, you can download the corpengine.py file (and res
    folder) manually.<br /><br />
